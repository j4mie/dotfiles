These are my dotfiles.

Notice there's no Makefile. This stuff only gets used very occasionally: when I get a new computer (or wipe my existing one). I'd rather spend ten minutes symlinking a few files by hand than write something that automagically moves around vital files.

The vim stuff isn't commented very well. Sorry. That's because I don't really understand it myself. Fortunately, it's pretty minimal anyway.
